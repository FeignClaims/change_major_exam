Programming for under graduate students graduation audits: read basic information, according to the requirements of graduation audit, output the information into ``studentGradutate.data`` file.

Among them, under graduate students are required to complete at least 150 credits, and graduate students are required to complete at least 36 credits, and pass both teaching practice and scientific research assessement.

The contents of the question include:

:cpp:`UStudent`
  .. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
        
    string strId;     // Student number
    string strNames;  // Student name
    double dCredits;  // Credits completed
    bool bResult;     // Can graduate or not

:cpp:`GStudent`
  .. code-block:: cpp
    :linenos:
        
    string strId;     // Student number
    string strNames;  // Student name
    double dCredits;  // Credits completed
    bool bResult;     // Can graduate or not
    bool bTeaching;   // Pass teaching practice or not
    bool bResearch;   // Pass scientific research assessement or not

Complete the following classes called :cpp:`Student`, :cpp:`UStudent`, :cpp:`GStudent`, and the :cpp:`main` function, so that the program can create a ``studentGraduate.data`` file as following correctly:

.. literalinclude:: 4.cpp
  :language: cpp
  :linenos:

.. code-block:: text
  :linenos:
  :caption: studentGraduate.data
