Write a program that takes a floating point as the input and translates it to amount in words.
The resulting amount in words should be rounded to the cent.
What's more, the program should apply to as large a number as possible.

For example,

.. code-block:: text
  :linenos:

  input: 123456.01
  output: 壹拾贰万叁仟肆佰伍拾陆元壹分
