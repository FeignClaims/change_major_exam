Complete the following tasks using the :cpp:`ForwardList` provided below,

1. Implement :cpp:`Queue1<T>` using :cpp:`ForwardList<T>` by privately inheritance.
2. Implement :cpp:`Queue2<T>` using :cpp:`ForwardList<T>` by composition.
3. Define a function template that consumes (get and pop element) all elements of the queue and print them out. After that, explicitly instantiate it with :cpp:`Queue1<char>` and specialize it with :cpp:`Queue2<int>`.
